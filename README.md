# How we built it

**React:** Balance Pad was built using React. This allowed for us to easily combine the different webpages we each worked on. 

**JavaScript, HTML, and CSS:** React builds on these languages so it was necessary to gain familiarity with them

**Assembly API:** The assembly API was used to convert live audio/video into text

**Twilio:** This was used to send instant messages to users based on tracked accomplishments

# Challenges we ran into
> - Launching new apps with React via Visual Studio Code
> - Using Axios to run API calls
> - Displaying JSON information
> - Domain hosting of Class Pad
> - Working with Twilio

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
_Pranati:_ I am proud that I was able to learn React from scratch, work with new tech such as Axios, and successfully use the Assembly API to create the Class Pad (something I am passionate about). I was able to persevere through errors and build a working product that is impactful. This is my first hackathon and I am glad I had so much fun. 

_Simi:_ This was my first time using React, Node.js, and Visual Studio. I don't have a lot of CS experience so the learning curve was steep but rewarding! 

_Amitesh:_ Got to work with a team to bring a complicated idea to life!

# What we learned
_Amitesh:_  Troubleshooting domain creation for various pages, supporting teammates and teaching concepts

_Pranati:_ I learned how to use new tech such as React, new concepts such API calls using Axios, how to debug efficiently, and how to work and collaborate in a team

_Simi:_ I learned how APIs work, basic html, and how React modularizes code. Also learned the value of hackathons as this was my first

#What's next for Balance Pad
_Visualizing Music:_  Our group hopes to integrate BeatCaps software to our page in the future. This would allow a more interactive music experience for users and also allow hearing impaired individuals to experience music
_Real Time Transcription:_ Our group hopes to implement in real time transcription in the Class Pad to make it even easier for students.
